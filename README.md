conversion of triangulated surfaces to (coarse grain) membrane models for molecular simulation. It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

TS2CG is an algorithm to backmap a triangulated surface (TS) structure to a corresponding coarse-grained (CG) model. TS2CG is implemented in C++ and includes two separate scripts. Pointillism and CG Membrane Builder.
